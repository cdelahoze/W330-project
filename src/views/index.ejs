    <h4>Stratified sampling</h4>
    <p>
      In statistics, stratified sampling is a method of sampling from a
      population which can be partitioned into subpopulations.<br />

      <br />In statistical surveys, when subpopulations within an overall
      population vary, it could be advantageous to sample each subpopulation
      (stratum) independently.<br />

      <br />Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population
      into homogeneous subgroups before sampling. The strata should define a
      partition of the population. That is, it should be collectively exhaustive
      and mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned
      to one and only one stratum. Then simple random sampling is applied within
      each stratum. The objective is to improve the precision of the sample by
      reducing sampling error. It can produce a weighted mean that has less
      variability than the arithmetic mean of a simple random sample of the
      population.<br />

      <br />In computational statistics, stratified sampling is a method of
      variance reduction when Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate
      population statistics from a known population.[1]
    </p>

    <h4>Stratified sampling strategies</h4>

    <p>
      1. <b><i>Proportionate allocation</i></b> uses a sampling fraction in each
      of the strata that are proportional to that of the total population. For
      instance, if the population consists of <i>n</i> total individuals,
      <i>m</i> of which are male and <i>f</i> female (and where <i>m</i> +
      <i>f</i> = <i>n</i>), then the relative size of the two samples (<i
        >x<sub>1</sub></i
      >
      = <i>m/n</i> males, <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> = <i>f/n</i> females) should
      reflect this proportion.<br /><br />

      2. <b><i>Optimum allocation</i></b> (or
      <i>disproportionate allocation</i>) - The sampling fraction of each
      stratum is proportionate to both the proportion (as above) and the
      standard deviation of the distribution of the variable. Larger samples are
      taken in the strata with the greatest variability to generate the least
      possible overall sampling variance.<br /><br />

      A real-world example of using stratified sampling would be for a political
      Statistical survey. If the respondents needed to reflect the diversity of
      the population, the researcher would specifically seek to include
      participants of various minority groups such as race or religion, based on
      their proportionality to the total population as mentioned above. A
      stratified survey could thus claim to be more representative of the
      population than a survey of simple random sampling or systematic sampling
    </p>
    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
      The reasons to use stratified sampling rather than simple random sampling
      include<br /><br />

      If measurements within strata have a lower standard deviation (as compared
      to the overall standard deviation in the population), stratification gives
      a smaller error in estimation.<br /><br />
      For many applications, measurements become more manageable and/or cheaper
      when the population is grouped into strata.<br /><br />
      When it is desirable to have estimates of the population parameters for
      groups within the population - stratified sampling verifies we have enough
      samples from the strata of interest.<br /><br />
      If the population density varies greatly within a region, stratified
      sampling will ensure that estimates can be made with equal accuracy in
      different parts of the region, and that comparisons of sub-regions can be
      made with equal statistical power. For example, in Ontario a survey taken
      throughout the province might use a larger sampling fraction in the less
      populated north, since the disparity in population between north and south
      is so great that a sampling fraction based on the provincial sample as a
      whole might result in the collection of only a handful of data from the
      north
    </p>
    <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
    <p>
      Stratified sampling is not useful when the population cannot be
      exhaustively partitioned into disjoint subgroups. It would be a
      misapplication of the technique to make subgroups' sample sizes
      proportional to the amount of data available from the subgroups, rather
      than scaling sample sizes to subgroup sizes (or to their variances, if
      known to vary significantlyâ€”e.g. using an F Test). Data representing each
      subgroup are taken to be of equal importance if suspected variation among
      them warrants stratified sampling. If subgroup variances differ
      significantly and the data needs to be stratified by variance, it is not
      possible to simultaneously make each subgroup sample size proportional to
      subgroup size within the total population. For an efficient way to
      partition sampling resources among groups that vary in their means,
      variance and costs, see "optimum allocation". The problem of stratified
      sampling in the case of unknown class priors (ratio of subpopulations in
      the entire population) can have a deleterious effect on the performance of
      any analysis on the dataset, e.g. classification.[3] In that regard,
      minimax sampling ratio can be used to make the dataset robust with respect
      to uncertainty in the underlying data generating process.<br /><br />

      Combining sub-strata to ensure adequate numbers can lead to Simpson's
      paradox, where trends that exist in different groups of data disappear or
      even reverse when the groups are combined.
